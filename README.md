# Clothing Store Marketing Stategy

## Project Details
This project is based on data gathered from a clothing store chain that uses various marketing initiatives to promote sales. The task is to classify which customers will respond to mail marketing campaigns based on data collected from past customers. The ultimate objective is to the increase the profitability of the store, and you are given a cost-benefit table below to help determine the optimal classification threshold. A false negative is a more costly error than a false positive for this business scenario, as the cost of sending a marketing mail is lower than the profit generated by a responded customer. The response variable is “customerIsResponse”. The “customerID” field is unique, automatically generated, and has no relation to the other variables.
